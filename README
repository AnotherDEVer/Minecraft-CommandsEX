CommandsEX, Build Your Very Own CraftBukkit Plugin

If you ever needed a single function but had to download a massive plugin that contained it, you will probably know the feeling. It could be hard to pick up the right plugin-set for a server with all the plugins currently in existence. Especially since many of them conflict with each other.
That is the idea behind CommandsEX project - to allow server administrators to choose which commands and functions they really need and let them trash all the rest.


How it works?

CommandsEX comes in a full-build flavor that is officially being distributed via the BukkitDEV website (http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/commandsex).
If a person needs to exclude some functionality from the plugin, they can do it in one of the following ways:

- by visiting the CommandsEX Builder page (http://commandsex.sourceforge.net)
- by removing unneccessary files from the JAR file itself and adjusting plugin.yml file


Permissions and Economy support?

CommandsEX makes use of Bukkit's built-in permissions model (SuperPerms) for basic permission checks (such as if a player has access to a certain action).
From version 1.40, CommandsEX also supports Vault plugin, which allows for extended permission checks (e.g. checking user groups etc.). This allows for the use of any plugin that Vault supports (such as PermissionsEx, bPermissions, ...)
For list of permissions, check out the "What is included" section on the SourceForge Wiki (https://sourceforge.net/p/commandsex/wiki/CommandsEX%20CraftBukkit%20plugin%20Wiki/) - each command set uses its own permissions. There are also a few Global Permissions that you can use for various admin bypasses and such.
Thanks to the recent Vault inclusion, CommandsEX is now also able to support all types of economies that this plugin supports as well, such as iConomy, BOSEconomy and more.


Databases

CommandsEX allows you to make use of either SQLite or MySQL databases to store various player data.
This includes economy, per-user language settings and more. Configuration is available in the main config.yml file located in CommandsEX folder under your plugins directory.
Database usage is optional and there is also an option to turn it off completely in the config file itself.
