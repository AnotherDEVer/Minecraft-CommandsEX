# information required to create XMPP (Jabber) connection from your Minecraft server to XMPP server's room
# - xmppUser: name of the user under which we'll log in to the XMPP (Jabber) service itself
# - xmppHost: the XMPP (Jabber) server, e.g. jabber.com (so when your username is john@jabber.com, user = john, host = jabber.com)
# - xmppPassword: password to use to log the user into the server
# - xmppRoom: name of the room where all chat will happen. This is REQUIRED.
#             You may need to find a service which provides Jabber rooms. I use conf.netlab.cz
#             Therefore my room name is "myroom@conf.netlab.cz" - myroom being the room name, conf.netlab.cz the hostname
# - xmppRoom.password: if the room requires a password to join it, set it up here
# - xmppBotNick: this is the nickname for the plugin. All chat will originate from this nickname.
#                You will, however see who did each chat message originate from.
# - xmppCommandPrefix: when a person from the Jabber room starts line with this character, it will be passed through to the Bukkit server
#                      and executed as if it was an ordinary command from the CONSOLE! Therefore be sure to only add players to xmppAdmins you really trust!
