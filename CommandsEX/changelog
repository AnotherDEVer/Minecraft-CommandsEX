- fixed permission nodes for rain and storm commands (they are now cex.weather.rain and cex.weather.storm instead of cex.rain and cex.storm)
- fixed URL leading to explanation about Chat Color Codes

- fixed description of kits and their permissions in the config file
- optimized muting when there are no players muted anymore
