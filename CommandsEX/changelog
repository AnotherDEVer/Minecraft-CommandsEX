Beta 1.35
---------
- source code is no longer being stored in the plugin JAR file to save download bandwidth (it's still available on GitHub)
- updated chat/console replacements code to reflect latest Commander code updates
- added join/leave chat messages grouping support
- added XMPP (Jabber) chat relay (you can see what's being blabbered on your server in a Jabber room and vice-versa now)
